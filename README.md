## 📰 News

- 🎮 **2026-09-04** — Released [UE simulation pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.03557) for the Echo-WM world data engine, covering physics-based trajectory generation, Movie Render Queue rendering, and distributed scheduling.
- 🚀 **2026-08-28** — Released [JoyAI-Echo 1.5 / Echo-LongVideo](echo_longvideo/README.md), including long-horizon generation, consumer-GPU inference profiles, and the Director Agent.
- 🌍 **2026-08-26** — Released [Echo-WM](echo_wm/README.md), our omnimodal world model for interactive audio-visual generation.
- 🎬 **2026-06-22** — Released [JoyAI-Echo 1.0](https://github.com/jd-opensource/JoyAI-Echo/tree/echo1.0), now preserved on the `echo1.0` archive branch.

This repository holds two independent projects. Each has its own environment,
checkpoints, and entrypoint — pick the one you need and follow its README.

| Project | What it does | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| **Echo-LongVideo** (long video) | Long-horizon, multi-shot audio-visual generation. Supports 10+ minutes of long-horizon generation, with a paired audio-video memory bank carrying continuity across shots. | [`echo_longvideo/`](echo_longvideo/README.md) |
| **Echo-WM** (world model) | Omnimodal world model for generative media that responds to continuous navigation while video, environmental sound, music, and speech evolve together. | [`echo_wm/`](echo_wm/README.md) |

```text
JoyAI-Echo/
├── echo_longvideo/   # long-video generation: inference.py, configs/, prompts/, ltx-*
└── echo_wm/          # world model: inference_wm.py, Gradio demo, bundled ltx-*
```

The two do not share a Python environment or a checkpoint directory. `echo_wm/`
bundles its own copy of `ltx-core` and `ltx-pipelines`, so installing one project
never affects the other.

## Quickstart

Long video:

```bash
cd echo_longvideo
conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate echo-long
```

World model:

```bash
cd echo_wm
conda create -n echo-wm python=3.11 -y && conda activate echo-wm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Checkpoints are downloaded separately in both cases. See each README for the
exact files and paths.

## Echo-WM Roadmap

Echo-WM is on **LTX-2.3** today. Next we move Base and Causal onto **LTX-2.5**,
then cut long-rollout cost with sparse attention and a tighter cache / runtime
stack.

### Backbone

- [x] **LTX-2.3 · Base** — bidirectional audio-visual DiT used by Echo-WM Base (~10 s).
- [x] **LTX-2.3 · Flash Preview / Causal** — current public preview with chunk-causal attention, KV-cache rollout, and 4-step inference. See [`echo_wm/README_CAUSAL.md`](echo_wm/README_CAUSAL.md).
- [ ] **LTX-2.5 · Base** — load official LTX-2.5 weights (Gemma 4 TE, 2.5 VAE / DiT) into the existing bidirectional path.
- [ ] **LTX-2.5 · Causal** — the same Flash recipe on 2.5: block-causal masks, sink+FIFO cache, few-step student.

### Accel

- [ ] **Sparse attention** — SageAttention and similar sparse / low-bit kernels on video, audio, and UCPE branches.
- [ ] **FlashAttention / FlashInfer** — fused attention for long causal windows without blowing up HBM.
- [ ] **Paged KV-cache** — variable-length cache so rollouts stay bounded; rebase RoPE and UCPE when tokens evict.
- [ ] **FP8 / TensorRT** — compile the DiT forward at lower precision for decode-time throughput.
